            <p>Modern search systems offer various advanced features that significantly improve the user experience. These features make it easier for users to find exactly what they're looking for.</p>

            <h2>Faceted Search</h2>
            <p>Faceted search allows users to narrow down search results by applying multiple filters across different dimensions of the data. Common facets include categories, tags, dates, and prices.</p>

            <h2>Fuzzy Matching</h2>
            <p>Fuzzy matching helps users find relevant results even when their search terms contain typos or spelling variations. This is typically implemented using techniques like Levenshtein distance.</p>

            <h2>Relevance Ranking</h2>
            <p>A good search system doesn't just find matching documents but also ranks them by relevance. This often involves complex algorithms that consider factors like term frequency, term proximity, and document popularity.</p>
